This is a command-line trading bot for Kraken Futures that uses a momentum and scalping strategy to trade perpetual futures contracts.

## üìà Strategy Overview

The bot identifies trading signals based on:
- **24h price momentum**: Targets assets with strong positive momentum.
- **Volume confirmation**: Ensures liquidity and tradeability.
- **Open interest (future improvement)**: Potential to filter pump-and-dump traps.

Once a signal is triggered:
- The bot enters a **long** position (shorting coming soon).
- Risk is limited to 5% of portfolio capital per trade.
- Positions are automatically closed based on:
  - **Stop-loss**: 3%
  - **Take-profit**: 7%
  - **Trailing time-based funding cost**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Features

- Simulated trades track:
  - Entry & exit prices
  - Capital used
  - ROE %
  - Fees and funding costs
  - PnL and trade result

- Logs are saved in `simulation.log`
- Final trade report is exported to `trade_summary.csv`
